# Weight Converter
The Weight Converter is a simple web application that allows users to convert a weight value from pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg). It provides a user-friendly interface and immediate feedback on conversions. This README will provide an overview of the project structure, how to use the application, and the technologies used.


## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- 'index.html': This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page, including the input field, conversion result, and error message display.

- 'style.css': The CSS file responsible for styling the web page and making it visually appealing. It includes styles for the container, input field, and error message.

- 'index.js': The JavaScript file that provides the functionality for the weight conversion and user interaction. It also handles input validation and displays error messages.
## How to Use the Weight Converter
1. Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser.

2. You will see a web page with a title "Weight Converter" and an input field labeled "Pounds."

3. Enter a weight value in pounds that you want to convert in the input field.

4. The application will immediately display the converted weight in kilograms below the input field.

5. If you enter an invalid number (e.g., a negative number or non-numeric characters), an error message will be displayed in red. The error message will disappear after 2 seconds.

6. If you enter a valid number, the converted weight in kilograms will be displayed for 10 seconds and then disappear.

7. You can convert additional weights by entering new values in the input field.
## Technologies Used
The Weight Converter web application is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: The structure of the web page is defined in HTML, including input elements and placeholders.

- CSS: The web page is styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- JavaScript: The functionality of the application, including weight conversion and error handling, is implemented in JavaScript.
## Styling and Design
The application features a responsive and visually appealing design:

- The background is a gradient from yellow to light blue, providing an attractive visual appeal.

- The container has a semi-transparent white background with a box shadow and rounded corners, giving it a modern and stylish look.

- The input field and error message are designed to be clear and user-friendly, with easy-to-read fonts and color schemes.
